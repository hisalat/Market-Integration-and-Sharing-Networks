*THE EFFECT OF MARKET INTEGRATION ON SHARING NETWORKS IN A RURAL AMAZIGH COMMUNITY* 


## 2. Thesis Abstract
Sharing is a common risk-buffering strategy across societies. Increased market 
integration in several subsistence and mixed-economy societies has yielded different 
effects on sharing networks. We test whether income from wage labor and fluency in 
Darija affect the number of kin, nonkin, in-community, and extra-community ties. We 
also test whether they affect trust in financial institutions. We use economic games to 
investigate whether market integration increases generosity towards nonkin and 
other community projects. Income from wage labor or taxi and fluency in Darija were 
associated with increased reliance on nonkin and extra-community ties in 
nontraditional sharing networks, while they were not associated with a decreased 
reliance on kin and in-community ties. Also, wage labor and Darija fluency were 
associated with an increased probability of having bank savings, while only wage 
labor was associated with increased trustworthiness in financial institutions. In 
regards to economic games income from wage labor and fluency in Darija were not 
associated with increased generosity towards nonkin and other communities. 
Increased market integration had increased reliance on nonkin but did not alter 
traditional sharing networks. 

## 3. Overview of this repository
This repository contains the code used for investigating the effects of market integration on sharing networks in a subsistence and mixed-economy community. The study specifically examines how factors such as income from wage labor and fluency in Darija impact the dynamics of kin, nonkin, in-community, and extra-community ties, as well as trust in financial institutions.
